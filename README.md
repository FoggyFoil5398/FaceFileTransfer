# FaceFileTransfer

NOTE (LIBRARIES NEEDED) : The code requires you to have face_recognition, os and shutil libraries in order to work.

This repo includes approximately 20-25 lines of code and was made with the intent of copying photos from one directory to another having a certain face as the main subject in the image. 

For example, I have a collection of 10000 photographs from an event in which I want to get all of my photos from the huge collection in another folder. Manually selecting these photographs is a time consuming task. How about a piece of code to do the work while you leave your computer/laptop open and running ? This is what the code exactly does !

There are certain limitations to the process though : 
 1. You have to manually give the location of the file name of the photo of the subject to be searched from the collection, the directory containing all the photos, the directory where you want to transfer the photos !
 2. Depending upon the resolution of the photos being searched, the process is time consuming. The only good part is you don't have to select the photos manually, it can happen in the background !
 3. You need to manually copy the folder containing all the photos to your desktop or create a new directory and paste all the photos in your desktop since a pendrive cannot be treated as a directory and the operations thus being performed afterwards will fail !
 
 
 

Feel free to contribute to the code if you want to make the things better ! Every pull request will be acknowledged ! 




Peace People !
